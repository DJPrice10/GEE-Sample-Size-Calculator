# GEE-Sample-Size-Calculator

R Code to run local instance of the GEE sample size calculator Shiny app, which can be found at:

If the online version is not working, use the R code in this folder to run a local instance of the calculator.

Simply save the app.R file to your computer. Ensure the Shiny package is installed (i.e., install.packages('shiny')). Open the script, and run by either clicking the "Run App" button in RStudio, or select all (Ctrl/Cmd + A) and "Run" (or Ctrl/Cmd + Enter).
